                excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the 
                existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet 
                into this very page. The HTML remains the same, the only thing that has changed
                is the external CSS file. Yes, really.</p>

                the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure.
                Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can 
                always push it further.</p>
